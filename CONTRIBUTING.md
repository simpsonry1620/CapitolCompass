# Contributing to CapitolCompass

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CapitolCompass! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the CapitolCompass <a href="https://github.com/simpsonry1620/CapitolCompass/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [rsimpson@nvidia.com].

## What Can I Do?

- **Developers**: Contributions in the form of code are what drive this project forward and make it an invaluable tool for everyone. If you're looking to contribute code, check out the "Getting Started" section below.
- **Non-Developers**: You can contribute in many ways other than writing code. This includes enhancing documentation, reporting bugs, and suggesting enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine.
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

## How to Report a Bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in CapitolCompass, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

- **Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding conventions** (if specified) and has been adequately tested.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests. <a href="https://github.com/simpsonry1620/CapitolCompass/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md">Request Template</a>
- **Coding Standard** - This project aims to standardize the coding style following <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>
