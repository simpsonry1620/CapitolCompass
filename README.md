# CapitolCompass
## Overview
CapitolCompass is an open-source Python <b>(in development)</b> project designed to automate and streamline legislative affairs workflows. By leveraging advanced technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), CapitolCompass assists organizations in navigating the complexities of legislative processes. This tool is crafted to enhance the efficiency of briefing organizational leadership on congressional testimonies, preparing talking points and congressional biographies, and analyzing bills and legislative proposals.

## Objectives
* <b>Transcript Accessibility:</b> To create accessible, referenceable, and unambiguous transcripts of congressional testimonies that relate to organizational responsibilities.
* <b>Material Preparation:</b> To automate the preparation of talking points, congressional biographies, and other essential materials for engagements with members of Congress.
* <b>Legislative Analysis:</b> To conduct detailed analyses of bills, legislative proposals, and policy briefs, evaluating their implications for organizational strategies.
* <b>Technology Leverage:</b> To utilize advanced LLMs for tasks such as speech-to-text transcription, semantic text search, and text summarization, thereby reducing manual workload and improving legislative engagement outcomes.
* <b>Data Access:</b> To facilitate access to Publicly Available Information (PAI) and non-public organizational data assets for comprehensive analysis and preparation.


## Methodology
CapitolCompass integrates a multi-faceted approach to address the challenges of legislative affairs:

* <b>Data Collection:</b> Aggregating data from verified PAI sources and organizational records.
* <b>LLM Integration:</b> Employing LLMs for natural language processing tasks to interpret, summarize, and classify legislative documents.
* <b>Analysis Tools:</b> Developing analytical tools to assess the impact of legislative changes on organizational policies and strategies.
* <b>User Interface:</b> Providing a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to access and interact with legislative data and analyses.

## Technologies
* <b>Python:</b> The core programming language used for development.
* <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> Utilized for text analysis, summarization, and classification tasks.
* <b>Speech-to-Text APIs:</b>  For converting congressional testimonies and debates into text.
* <b>Semantic Search Engines:</b>  To enhance the searchability of legislative documents and data.
